# Create an image full of takos
Python script to generate a png filled with takos, using [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow). Just run create-img-with-takos.py to create the image.

You can customize:
- Which tako should be multiplied
- Squish or inflate the tako (actually, it's a resize)
- How many takos per row / per column
- How stacked / separated the takos should be
- How much the takos can roll

You can use it to fill the canvas with any other image, but why you do that?

Tako before (lonely) | Tako after (full of friends)
